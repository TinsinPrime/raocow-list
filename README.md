# raocow-list
A new location for the raolist project, originally hosted at Tinsin.Party!

The raocow list was made in MultiMarkdown, with style additions from Bootstrap 4.  
However, with the use of Jekyll, I was able to more cleanly edit the page, so that's what I'm using going forward.

For best results, check it out on Render at https://the-raocow-list.onrender.com/ !
